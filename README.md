In this project I used a dataset found on Kaggle, that included almost 800,000 pieces of text that were either created by LLM's or humans. It also included the labels for whether each piece of text was created by a LLM or human.

I used various NLP techniques to preprocess the data, then I fed this data into a Bidirectional Neural Network to see if I could fit a model that would predict whether a given text is generated by a LLM or human. The model performed well with an almost 90% accuracy on the testing data. I am looking into expanding this further with ensemble models, feature engineering, data expansion, and some new forms of NLP. This project has broad applications across acadamia, but I urge everyone to not rely on any model like this for the final say in whether an essay is generated by a LLM or human; models make mistakes.

This model has almost a 90% accuracy score, and I anticipate that will increase as I train for longer periods and make other fine tunings.
